\section*{Acknowledgement}

The exercise of writing what came to be this book, has made me appreciate how few things are actually truly originial. This books is in a way the combination of personal experiences and the many books I've read growing up; and very little in this books should thus be attributed to me. It has also made me realize how much help I can receive if I only ask; and for that I'm deeply greatful.
