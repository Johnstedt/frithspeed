			Our sun be eternal bound,
			Alone she goes around;
			Her shackles that of natural law,%Her loneliness that of natural law —
			Yet she smiles; and thy bones thaw.

			And trees the east salute,
			To whom that bears them fruit.
			Although raised in different glades,
			They cast but similar shades.

			What an angle may disclose,
			To thee, and he who knows; % SPELLING ERR To thee, and he who knows, and those who knows
			With stick and stones to be precise,
			Of where a shadow bound to slice.

			A sun's eternally bound,
			To us distant yet profound —
			To tell the pace of the Sublime,
			And thus thou know about the Time.

%Her solitude that of natural law,%Her loneliness that of natural law —
%Yet she smiles; and thy heart thaw.
