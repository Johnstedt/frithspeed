\chapter{Wadborough forest}

The Wadborough forest is a peculiar patch of land. It's the only forest for miles and sticks out in the patchwork of farmlands surrounding the village of Wadborough. The forest was left untouched when the village was first founded many centuries ago and keep as shooting ground. Pheasants was imported and the villagers, to increase their yield, set out to remove their natural predators. \\

Pheasants are clumsy birds, used to roaming the Asian steps undisturbed from predators - they had difficulty surviving in the forest of Wadborough. Over the years the villagers drove all major predators out of the region. The red fox was first to as they seem to hunt the pheasants out of sport, killing more than they could eat. The stoat, wolverine and the mink followed shortly after. The weasels and badgers were hunted to low numbers but kept alive as they mostly ate rodents, which consequently was booming without the predators. \\

Against the will of the Wadborough villagers the bill of wildlife preservation act was past in the county of Worcestershire which holds the legislative power in Wadborough. It contained many paragraphs but no one as stringent as §68.

\begin{localsize}{10}
\begin{quote}
'A person shall not hunt game birds such as the Common Pheasant by means of firearm or any form of projectiles unless bread in captivity under permission from state licensed breeder. A person guilty of an offense under this Act shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 5.000 pound sterling.'
\begin{flushright}- §68 Bill of Wildlife Preservation Act\end{flushright}
\end{quote} 
\end{localsize}

Although the villagers did not abide by the law in the first few years after its initial passing, they eventually followed suit after a tens of hefty fines had been past witch, to the amusement of many locals, became known as the great shooting purge of '08.\\

And so it came to be that the forest of Wadborough was free of both man and predator - undisturbed by the natural checks that keeps the order of things.

\chapter{Dignity}

Deep underground in the comfort of a burrow	a chipmunk woke with a jerk of excitement. He had waited for this morning all spring, working many extra shifts in the tunnels and picking blueberries on the weekends. His ambitions had always been to leave the borrows and move above ground and finally he had saved up enough to do so. Chipmunks who usually enjoy their time underground and had given him the name Supram. It's short for 'Et qui super terram' from the old scriptures which loosely translates to 'He who lives above ground'.\\

Supram rose out of bed and rushed out from the burrow, following the runs twist and turns until it widen into a great hall. Many chipmunks had already gathered there and as soon as Supram entered a Chipmunk in the front of the hall turned against the others, facing them, and began to speak. 
'Early bird freight the world' he began with a loud but calm voice. 

'Early worm freight the world' the other chipmunks answered in chorus.

'So..' the he continued promptly, 'There was another collapse in tunnel F2 last night'. He let the room sit for a bit to allow for the news to sink in before he continued 'A dumwit of a pheasant went chasing a magpie and, well, it caved'

'Again!? Really!?' the largest of the few, Greenberry almost shouted. 
'This must be the third time these last couple of weeks, Ripell, you've promised they would behave'

The first chipmunk, Ripell took a deep breath before he answered
'I don't know what to tell you, I've talked to the crows and they assured the pheasants would keep in their perimeters'

'I for sure won't talk to the moles again' Greenberry mustered after a few moments of silence.

The deep network of tunnels under the forest was not just the chipmunks doing. Although excellent diggers, they still stood no match against the moles who mostly dug the wider paths like F2. Moles are however not so pleasant to deal with, they're grumpy almost like toddlers and seem to hate every second of conversations they must endure. 

'No I will deal with them, I'll bring Shrub'. 

Shrub jerked nervously as if being suddenly woken from a dream and simply nodded in a gesture of compliance. 

'As you all know, we're still in the middle of berry season. The rabbits expects us finish the celery deliveries today and the flow of berries won't stop any time soon. Chop chop, get on with it' Ripell ended. 

The chipmunks started to slowly wander out from the hall. Supram lingered, waiting for the others to leave. 

'Supram' Forell began. 

'Father'
