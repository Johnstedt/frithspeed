		But first, fellow Animals, I would like to say this: it is in difficult times we get to show what we have been made of---our true colours and morals. And I am certain, ye colours shall burn true and as bright as ever! Our Forest shall endure, as it always hath endured: since the time of Man and the founding of this very Glade. I promise ye, we shall---once again---unite against our common foe, and earn a second wind with this imminent victory!
