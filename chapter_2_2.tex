"One day is today---", Kraerion whispered to himself as his tired eyes slowly widened to an open state. The chimpunk had woke---like all mornings---to a load unpleasant banging sound echoing around the run outside the comforts of his small burrow. The sound carried with it the news of a new day, and with it the message that all who wanted a day's pay ought to drag themselves to the great hall, the Aorta, presently. The frowsty air this deep underground usually made him rise as soon as he woke---to seek more pleasant ambiance---but today he lingered in thoughts.

"One day is today.", he repeated reassure himself and still his doubts, as if repeating the words would make them more true. The power of inertia is strong; Kraerion full well knew of its insidious nature: that tomorrow and never were but equal measurements of eternity. He had longed---even dreamed---for this day to come for as long as he could remember; so he wondered why---now when the day was finally here---had he so suddenly lost his strong convictions.

Chipmunks might be genetically poised for a life underground, but not the chipmunk Kraerion. Even as a little kitten, he had loathed: the damp runs and burrows, the second-hand air, the ever present darkness, and about everything else underground just by association. He hated---as only an adolescent can hate---that which most of his peers called home.
Instead, he wished for a strong wind in his fur, sunlight that uncovered all the beauty that is Nature, but most of all the chaotic buzzing of life above that so differed from the routines down below. He yearned to run the branches of trees, not the ever branching network of runs dug in the forest soil. His father had many a time japed that his son was born more a squirrel than chipmunk---and he had not been wrong. When he was younger, he had stated that one day he was going to live amongst the trees, but received feedback which would otherwise only be appropriate after a well executed joke.

Kraerion eventually mustered the will to rise from his moss coated bed. He went over to a corner of his burrow and began scratching away at the dirt.

"Good, still here.", he confirmed anxiously, as the felt the steel of three steel screw-nuts---which would surely appear beautiful in the sunlight---laying before him. He covered them up again and left his burrow into the run, and followed its twists and turns until it widened into a great hall: the Aorta. It was dug under a great willow; its massive network of roots---intertwined with the walls and ceiling---supported the weight of the dirt and kept it from caving in.\\

Since the time of Man, the forest had steadily increased its economic output. And one of the  contributing factors was the increased specialization of its inhabitants. Whilst many a specie have some certain advantage in the gathering of some certain type of feed, none is as great a carrier than that of the chipmunk. In their elastic cheeks, they are able to carry loads of feed---and other goods for that matter---efficiently around the forest; their small size and great numbers gave the operation a granularity to it, which made it difficult for larger and stronger animals like the roebuck to compete. When other animals began to hire them for their service, they began to expand their network of tunnels and runs to cover whole forest---connecting all its major hubs. Therefor---every morning---the chipmunks gathered in the Aorta to share news and plan the day ahead.

Most chipmunks were already present when Kraerion entered. 

"One day is today.", he thought again as he  headed towards his usual spot in the front. But he hesitated suddenly and reconsidered; instead, he decided to begin his new life with breaking this habit and found a place in the back.\\

The murmur of conversation disappeared in an instance when an old chipmunk appeared in the Aorta. His name was Aequitus an was the chief chipmunk, gray spots of fur spoke of his age, yet his features were easy on the eye and he bore his age proudly. Everyone knew the chief and saw his as something akin to a revered hero. When he was but a kitten, he'd taken interest in the chipmunks' livelihood and noticed irregularities in their billings; after some deliberation with his friend Br'er Rabbit, he realized that they could likely double their prices with little to no churn. He put forth the motion to the then chief chipmunk who surprisingly listened to the youngster and approved it. When their income subsequently increased, he was very vocal about it and made it impossible for the chief chipmunk not to pass the forward to the chipmunks' daily wage.

When Aequitus a few years later was unanimously chosen as the next chief, he took it a step further. He transformed the chipmunks' enterprise to a sort of cooperative, with bylaws dictating that a fixed percentage of the total revenue and other initiatives limiting the influence of his own office---not only for himself but setting the precedence for his eventual replacements. 

Together with Br'er Rabbit---who had become the implicit leader of the rabbits---and helped by the then Glade of Representatives chair Ongenþeow, he started the Winter Fund. A collective fund that functions similar to that of insurance: its members contributes feed during the spring, summer, and autumn as a premium; members that find themselves short during the winter may then make a claim and receive feed to sustain them until winter's end.
A cynic human might proclaim the flaw in this scheme, that an animal might take advantage of it by wasting his wage and making a claim every winter---but he forgets two things: most animals can't count; and although possible, making a claim is very stigmatized and that most animals would rather starve than to broadcast their destitute. Aequitus---being a co-founder of the fund---made sure that all the work related to the logistics---moving and storing of the feed deep underground where the soil is grainy, cold, and preserves the feed from pest and rot, and hidden from nosy thieves---went to the chipmunks---further boosting the demand for their services.

The fund was a great success; winter deaths decreased drastically the first year, and then slowly decreased year after year. The chipmunks got more steady stream of sophisticated work from the fund and thus means for a better life. For all the contributions Aequitus made, none could match the feeling he instilled in every chipmunk: the intangible sense of worth; the standing the brought them to in the forest; and the care he fostered between chipmunks---treating them all as equals.\\

When Aequitus reached the front of the Aorta, he turned and faced scurry.

"Before we go through today's agenda, I have news---both good and bad.", he began, "And, as you may not be able to appreciate the good in anticipation of bad, I'll begin with the bad.", he took a tactful pause, as anyone with his level of experience would in this situation.

"The eastbound run collapsed late last evening; we're completely cut off from the eastern part of forest. Therefor, the deliveries to the rabbits' hill must be postponed."

"Why did it collapse?", Aequitus asked younger brother Pietus, who stood at his regular place just right of his brother.

"Well,", Aequitus dragged, "a pheasant went chasing a maggot again and crossed above the shallow no-zone."

"Again!?", Pietus cried, not hiding his contempt, "Did the pheasants not promise to be more careful---that last time would be the last? Will they pay for the damages per our agreement."

"They did indeed. As you all know, the pheasants are not the most organized of animals and will only blame each other if we claim for damages. We may bring it to the Glade, but what---other than appearing petty---would we gain? Little and less, I'm afraid. Nevertheless, I want you, Pietus, to go to the moles and have them dig a deeper eastbound run this time---that, at least, is a factor we can affect."
"I'll do it.", Pietus responded, "But send someone else to the moles next time---they don't even speak the common tongue..."

"Nā, hēo seċġaþ þone ealda sprǣċe. It is we that don't speak theirs."

Aequitus paused, waiting to see if Pietus had a response. When his brother only mumbled something inaudible, he continued.

"I'll make sure Br'er and the rabbits gets the news of the postponement personally. As for the good news, the rumors going around are true: the Glade have decided to institute a 2\% tax on all our shipments. It's only a temporary experiment with us as the pilot service."

"How is this good news??", Veritas squeaked, a tiny runt of a chipmunk also standing in the front close to Aequitus.

"Two reasons: firstly, the funds are marked as aid for destitute animals who can't afford the Winter Fund, and we'll get the contract for its logistics; secondly, we don't pay for our own services---we're essentially exempt!"

"No! That's not how it works.", Veritas snapped angrily, "this will increase our prices---hurt our margins; to only tax one industry, and ours at that---it's... it's incredibly unfair."

"Enough.", Aequitus grumbled, "That's enough, this is neither the place nor time, we may discuss this later in private."

Veritas did not answer, but she turned her head sideways---showing everyone her disdain.

The old chipmunk moved on to the day's normal agenda, dishing out more routinely orders before dismissing his workforce. However, his eyes were fixed on Kraerion---the dismissal did not apply to him. When the last chipmunk had left the Aorta, he began to speak.

"Kraerion---", he said.

"Father.", Kraerion responded, equally enthusiastic.
