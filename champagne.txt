Fragility is a trait seldom sought,
Yet in Crystal it is charm;
Yet it's found on the highest of shelves;
Expensive is what Champagne ougth,
to no be a slight of sort.


What it is, is what it's not
The bleak monday trot!


Fragility is a trait seldom sought,
Yet to Cristal it brings charm;
Expensive is what a champagne ought,
To not be a slight of sort;
In life, for meaning we fought,
Or what else to make of it all.

The glas that must not break
The cost, the weekday can't bear

What it is, is what it's not,
It's not the bleak weekday trot

The cost that can't be borne,
tells of friends to us dear

The glas that must not break,
tingles all the senses awake

To inflict pain on the morrow
Is the beauty of today

The cost that cant be borne,
aint but the vain brag
but the advertisement of meaning
- of affection
