The death of Aequitas left the chipmunks in disarray. With neither food nor leader the situation looked more dire the more the days passed. Pietas had earged Kraerion to fill his fathers place, and Kraerion, for the first time in his life, actually considered to do so. He did so, not because he particularly heeded Pietas advice, but because he didn't see any other way. He had grown up recieving the same education as his brother. He had learned every trick in the industry from his father, he knew he was the only chipmunk whom could hope to contain the disaster.

Three days after Aequitas death, the chipmunks held a ceremony for their fallen industrious leader. They gathered in the Aeortha, made some remarks about his life and listened to a nightingale's song whom they hired for the occasion. The song echoed unfortunate in the narrow tunnles and sounded as out of place as the nightingale himself looked underground. 

 
Kraerion had sold his hollow in the birch tree. A crow had offered him trice what he had spent to acquire it, yet the amount, which he promptly donated to the hungry, had been but a drop in the bucket in a vast see of hungry wavs. 
His hollow in the tree had been everything, his identity and way of life. It had been invaluable. In that value is subjective, to each his own, but in the end it had a face value. A face value that a crow, without much of a care, were willing to spend. "A nice place to spend summer weekends", he had said to Kraerion, "those were the sun only hides for an hour or two". Valued differently and equally, a paradox only a shift in denomination may cause where the past discounted and posterity borrowed. Where the frugal is punished at the hand of the lavish. Where spending is the only alternative left, save for spending some more.


He had returned home, but not like he'd imagined: After he'd found himself and could know the place for the first time.


He'd returned home, but not like the heros in the stories: who returns to arrive where he started and know the place for the first time. Because this is not one of those stories. This story is not about heros.

One may be apt to "to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.". This is not one of those stories.

%Value is subjective, but like a lemming flying off the edge off a cliff - only a few seek a valuation of their own. Value is but a means to an end, food on the table or a bed for the night. A small minority finds beauty in something scarce, dense and fungible; expanded by the majority by the function of value into something truly vast. The illusion of value becomes tangible and true - the function of value providing prosperity to all. Illusion is close to delusion, when the original beauty disappears the minority moves on, but not the lemming. The lemming sees but the folly of others, blind to the inevitable implosion. The vast wave of delusion ends in one giant crash against the cliff of lemming and the cycle begins anew.    

Value is subjective, but value itself fulfill a remarkable function in trade. For most value is but
