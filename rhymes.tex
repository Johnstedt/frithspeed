You ain't got no agency, you're trapped in Oceania,
but what do you know, stoned and high as if you were in Christiania

You're nothing but a replica, you're the lesser of twins,
You're the twin towers in America, here my plane comes, it spins. 

You're but an ugly shade
the only way you'll get a fair maid is through slave trade.
