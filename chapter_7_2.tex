The winter came early and hard. The migratory birds had long fled south to the more pleasant European-, and even African continent; the winter air were thus calm and quiet, save for the irregular cooing of the pigeons. The forest bed was covered in a thick layer of snow, its distribution made uneven by the wind and the trees. The animals hid in their burrows and lairs for most of the days, keeping close to preserve body heat. Winter but a game of waiting---a quarter of life on pause.

Kraerion wasn't immune to cold either, and he had prepared meticulously for winter: insulating the inner walls of his hollow with moss and lichen. He had Redrill carve him a round wooden piece, which could be rolled in front of his entrance to keep the shy warmth hostage. In the mornings though, he pushed the piece aside; he preferred the cold to the darkness, and a life in motion to a life on pause. He had watched as the days shrank shorter, the morning dew slowly morph to morning frost---a phenomenon difficult to grasp for a creature raised underground. And today---this particular morning---the sun rays danced for Kraerion's eyes on the unadulterated hoar frost covering the surface, seemingly stretching forever  in every direction. A dance of free admission, open to all, yet but a lone chipmunk hunched in a tree paid to enter---and in that moment, he was truly the richest animal in the forest.

The sun shifted and its rays partially blocked by a tree; the dance moved on to other avenues. Kraerion's mind wandered to the events in the glade: the attempted seizure of Αίσωπος, the death of the stoat, and the issued decree. The outlawed badger had never officially been attained, and no one knew where he was. Nevertheless, many a rumour spread like wildfire that summer. "He had been caught, killed, and buried by the stoats!", "No, he is still hiding in some old forgotten badgers' lair deep underground---biding his time!", "No, he sought out supporters to his cause, roaming the marshes to the east of the forest and preparing for war!"
