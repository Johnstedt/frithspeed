The winter came early and hard. The migratory birds had long fled south to the more pleasant European-, and even African continent; the winter air were thus calm and quiet, save for the irregular cooing of the pigeons. The forest bed was covered in a thick layer of snow, its distribution uneven due to the wind and the trees. The animals hid in their burrows and lairs for most of the days, keeping close to preserve body heat. Winter but a game of waiting---a quarter of life on pause.

Kraerion wasn't immune to cold either, and he had prepared meticulously for winter: insulating the inner walls of his hollow with moss and lichen. He had Redrill carve him a round wooden piece, which could be rolled in front of his entrance to keep the shy warmth hostage. In the mornings though, he pushed the piece aside; he preferred the cold to the darkness of a life on pause. He had watched as the days shrank shorter, the morning dew slowly morph to morning frost---a phenomenon difficult to dissect living underground.
