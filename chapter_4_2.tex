The crows watched as the animals poured in the glade---the Glade of Representatives. The murder sat comfortably tucked all along the branches of the ever reaching crown of the Old Oak. From afar it looked as if the Oak bore large, black acorns. Since the time of Man, the animals had gathered here to discuss public matters, to air opinions, and to converge on decisions. Although the glade bore a suggestive name, it wasn't a republic in the most human sense of the word. It wasn't a selected office: no animal spoke for a predefined set of members; instead, non present members usually had someone whom they trusted present, who could speak on their behalf if needed. In fact, the meetings in the Glade was open to everyone; and anyone who wished to speak could. The animal species differed though, in their eagerness to follow the discourse. Many of the crows and the rabbits were actively engaged in the discussions, and the presiding officer---responsible for the agenda and order---had been a crow for generations, and became referred to as the Twig. The rats and the blackbirds on the other hand, took little to no interest in the proceedings. The pheasants did not even attend; their concerns were more of worms, than with words.

Kraerion entered the Glade when it was almost full and opted---in the spirits of his now arboreal life---to join the birds amongst the trees. He was taken aback by the might of the Old Oak---its powerful branches and colourful leaves seemed as powerful and green as ever. As he found a comfy twig in a beech, he saw Aequitus, Pietus, and Veritas standing next to the rabbits; and his heart dropped. He felt at once uneasy. He knew he'd done nothing wrong by leaving, yet his body felt otherwise.

When the last roebuck straggled into the glade, a crow signaled for them to start. The crow took a few awkward skips out on the oak branch, so as to be seen by all. He bore the name Eaglewing. His right wing was unevenly discoloured: half the wing's feathers were of a peculiar colour of brown, not unlike the wings of an eagle. He had been an unlikely candidate to the office of Twig; although, he was the son of the previous one, Ongenþeow, but been born very much the runt of the litter. His discoloured wing was also rumored to be broken, and only a few crows could claim to have seen him fly. The crow began to speak:
