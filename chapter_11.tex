The beautiful long days of summer had past without Kraerion spending more than a few moments above ground. He spent most of his awaken hours working, carrying goods in his cheeks whilst orchestrating his instrument of chipmunks on what and which should go where and when. When he for a moment peeked out of one of the entrences one October morning, he was suprised to see the trees already flaming bright, the canopies covered in the orange colours of autum. "Where did the summer go?" he wondered solemnly as he realized he hadn't had the time to reflect on times passing. His thoughs quickly turned to anguish as he realized how close it was to winter and how much work was due by then. Although he felt like he pushed himself to the edge of sanity, he was kept humble be his uncle. Pietas worked close to 18 hour long days, sleeping in the Aorta as to always be on call if he was needed. He never complained, nor did he uttered any negative comment at all. Kraerion was very greatful for that, all chipmunks respected and when they eventually needed to increase the working hours most had gone along with it since Pietas stood fully behind the decision.

The sun had long gone down when Kraerion finally made it home. Their narrow living space was more gutter than burrow. The damp earthen walls leaning close, swallowing the burrow as the black saharan night swallows the glimmer of a lone dragonfly. Cinnamon had birthed three kittens earlier that spring, and as Kraerion entered, he paused for a momement at the entrance looking in. Their room was worse than his former birch appartment in every measureable way, yet it had a warmth only a family could bring, their shared memories wearing the walls, filling them with life and giving them a heavy invaluable quality and making it a home. As Kraering stood there, watching his kittens, he noticed how much they grown. "Trees are not the only thing I miss grow", he reflected solemnly.

"Are you not coming in?", Cinnamon asked, interupting his thoughts. 

A silence to build a home and be called lucky for it.

A sort of silence in which to build a house, move in, and call a home.
