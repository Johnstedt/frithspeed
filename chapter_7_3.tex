The winter came early and hard. The migratory birds had long fled south to the more pleasant European---and even African---continents; the winter air was thus calm and quiet, save for the irregular cooing of the pigeons. The forest bed was covered in a thick layer of snow, its distribution made uneven by the wind and the trees. The animals hid in their burrows and lairs for most of the days, huddled close to preserve body heat. Winter was but a game of waiting---a quarter of life on pause.

Kraerion wasn't immune to cold either, and he had prepared meticulously for winter: insulating the inner walls of his hollow with moss and lichen. He had Redrill carve him a round wooden disc, which could be rolled in front of his entrance to keep the shy warmth hostage.
In the mornings, though, he pushed the disc aside; he preferred the cold to the darkness, and a life in motion to a life on pause. He had watched as the days shrank, the morning dew slowly morph to morning frost---a phenomenon difficult to grasp for a creature raised underground. And today---this particular morning---the sun rays danced for Kraerion's eyes on the unadulterated hoar frost covering the surface, seemingly stretching forever in every direction. A dance of free admission, open to all, yet but a lone chipmunk hunched in a tree paid to attend---and, in that moment, he was truly the richest animal in the forest.\\

The sun shifted and its rays intercepted by a pine, the dance moved on to other glades. Kraerion's mind wandered to the events in the Glade: the attempted seizure of Αίσωπος, the death of the young stoat, and the Decree. The now outlawed badger had never officially been apprehended, and no one knew for sure where he was.
Nevertheless, many a rumour spread like wildfire that early winter. "He had been caught, killed, and buried by the stoats!", he had heard Spinestack boast to Greyhead.
"No, he is still in hiding in some old forgotten badgers' lair deep underground---biding his time!" Greyhead had conjectured back to Spinestack.
"No, he sought out supporters to his cause, roaming the marshes to the east of the forest and preparing for war!", a Robin had chimed to anyone who would listen as he flew by Kraerion's birch.

No one had definitive proof of their claims, yet the animals argued incessantly about it. Kraerion didn't know what to make of it himself. He didn't know the badger personally---no one truly did---but he had always appeared to him to be an animal of reason. He couldn't wrap his head around how quickly Eaglewing had reached a verdict. Could Αίσωπος really be that cut-throat?\\

His morning conundrum was abruptly disturbed by Cinnamon who suddenly, hastily entered the glade, in stark contrast to the leisurely pace of that late summer morning. This time she didn't stop at the base of the birch; instead---to Kraerion's surprise---she sprang up it without hesitation, her claws tearing at the bark in her urgency. When she reached the hollow, she was breathless, her small chest heaving as she fought to recover. She didn't have to speak for Kraerion to realize she came with news; and looking into her pearl black eyes, he saw that the news was grave.

"Veritas is dead", she finally mustered, still panting, "I think you better come."

They ran back together through the winter silence which no longer appeared nearly as beautiful as it had just a few minutes before, only heavy. They entered the run and Cinnamon led the way through the many twists and turns that were slowly fading from Kraerion's memory.
When they finally entered Veritas's spartan burrow, they were both out of breath. "There's too many chipmunks for this space...", Kraerion thought to himself as he pushed past the scurry with Cinnamon on his heels, "too many damn chipmunks."
He saw his father leaning over his sister's lifeless body---his forepaw gently resting on her chest. Pietus was also standing there; he looked up when they approached and gave them a silent nod. Aequitus didn't notice them or didn't care to show if he did.
Kraerion suddenly felt a cold thought creeping up his spine: "Even in death, she had defied Nature. animals seldom die in burrows; they seek a quiet, open space for their final rest. Veritas, however, chosen this confined space---sealing herself in with the very truth she preached."
Overwhelmed with emotions, Kraerion finally had enough. "Get out of here!", he screamed suddenly, the ferocity of his own voice surpised him, "Get out of here, all of you!"

When no one moved a limb, Aequitus finally looked up from Veritas's body. "You heard him", the Cheif bellowed, his voice ragged but commanding, "Get out!"

And so the chipmunks did---revealing that Kraerion's voice no longer carried the same weight as it once did. As the burrow emptied, Cinnamon turned to follow, but Kraerion quickly placed a paw on her shoulder. "Not you", he whispered, "stay with me."

When only Aequitus, Pietus, Cinnamon, and Kraerion remained in the burrow, they remained in silence. It was a heavy silence, as if by not speaking they could somehow deny the reality of the situation.

"What...", Kraerion asked at length, his voice trembling, "what happened?

"I..., she. I don't", Aequitus stammered, "I... I think she starved herself."

"What do you mean?", Kraerion asked confused, "She couldn't---why would she starve?"

Aequitus looked like he was about to speak, but the words died in his throat, a single tear rolling down his cheek before he turned away.

Pietus sighed heavily, "It's hard to say for certain what was going through her mind, but she was very angry with the Crows, and with me and your father. She had this idea that the Winter fund was underfunded, that we needed to sound the alarm, which the rest of us disagreed with. We even had to lock her in her burrow the day we met in the Glade of Representatives. After that, she became more withdrawn and started ration feed as a silent protest. But we never thought she would take it this far."

"Why did no one think to tell me?", Kraerion asked, now angry, "We could have saved her!"

"We did tell you Kraerion", Cinnamon interjected gently, trying with all her might to keep compassion in her voice, "Do you think it was easy for me to seek you out after you left like you did?"
