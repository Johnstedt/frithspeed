Deep winter had sealed the world, locking the promise of spring in a distant, unreachable future. The frost was not merely on the ground and in the trees; it was in the marrow. And while the turning of the earth guaranteed that spring must eventually conquer winter, to a starving animal, the 'eventual' is a rather poor substitute for the 'now'.

Yet, against the odds, the animals had endured---even done great given the circumstance. The tragedy of Veritas's death had served as a grim wake-up call. The chipmunks had heavily rationed their food stores, and that of the Winter Fund. Through influential animals loyal to them---like rabbits, and the hares---the message of low feed stores had been spread throughout the forest. It had been done subtly, very carefully, so as not to incite panic, and been effective enough to stop any real catastrophe in its tracks.

In the end, the animals were going to survive the winter, but it would still be the worst winter in living memory. And, as with any setback, there's plenty of blame to go around---whether the blame is justified is seldom of concern when seeking scapegoats.\\

``Eveything set?", Br'r Rabbit whispered to his right-paw rabbit Thlayli as the first light of dawn broke through into the glade. The two rabbits were hutched within a thick bush---invisible to any animal in the glade.

``Yes, Br'r", Thlayli replied softly, ``the beavers, the moles, the rats, the hares, the mice, the squirrels, the hedgehogs, and songbirds of various feathers, all have some form of representation in the area. Your message will not go unnoticed."

``How about the chipmunks, and the deer?", Br'r rabbit asked, as he licked his paw and anxiously dragged it over his long ears. ``Is Aequitus here?"

``No, Br'r.", Thlayli replied hesitantly, ``He's..---He's been hard to reach these days. But Pietus will be here. And, the two biggest deer-bucks have promised you their protection if fighting breaks out. I can't get a visual though, they are too big to hide here. They should be within earshot."

``Good enough.", Br'r Rabbit sighed, ``and the stoats?"

``Far away, Br'r.", Thlayli assured and a big grin spread across his face, ``They swallowed the bait of the Aesop sighting in the east meadows. Every stoat is off searching for him save for Eaglewings personal stoat. It was genius of you to spread the rumors through the moles---the crows are too arrogant to think blind animals in a strange tongue could contain any cunning."

``I still got one last trick in me.", Br'r Rabbit chuckled amused. ``Now let's get to work.".\\

Br'r Rabbit had always been full of tricks, using his cunning and wit to get his way. But he was not young anymore, and his brain growing slower for each day. He had been angry, very angry---both with himself and with the crows---for the introducing the stoats into the forest, and his own failure to act against it. His last trick, would be to release the bottled tension of the winter's suffering directly at the crows---tension that would erupt on Br'r rabbits terms.

Snow was still covering the ground, when Br'r Rabbit made his way to the edge of the Glade---the very spot where he had failed to act against the introduction of the stoats.\\

``This is not money!", he loudly proclaimed, his voice raw. ``This is a lie!"

He dug a small hole in the snow in front of the Old Oak, and into that hole, he deposited a large pile of leaves.

``We trusted your scheme, Eaglewing!", he cried, as animals gathered from all sides around him as planned, and a few sleepy crows came out of the Old Oak to see what the commotion was about. ``We followed everything you asked of the forest, yet we had to ration and starve just to get through the winter---is that what \textit{progress} is to you?"

Before he let any crow respond, he turned around, and with his short round white tail high in the air, he defecated on the pile of leaves.

``To all the animals present in this Glade:", Br'r Rabbit continued, ``Let it be known that henceforth, the rabbits will no longer accept leaves as a form payment for our goods or services. We will accept blueberries---and only blueberries---until the crows sees it fit to return our screw-nuts!"

Eaglewing appeared from a hollow in the Old Oak, his black feathers ruffled by the cold air. The crow glared down at Br'r Rabbit.

``What treachery be th...", he began, his voice sharp, but he was immediately interrupted by the thunder of a great buck stepping forward.

``\textbf{No leaves, no leaves, no leaves!}", the buck bellowed, and the chant was quickly taken up by the rest of the animals, until the entire glade was roaring in unison.

Eaglewing stiffened. He opened his beak to retort, to weave a spell of words as he had done so often, but his voice was drowned in the feverish chant. He saw the anger in their eyes---a hunger that mere rhetoric could not feed. A rebuke at this moment would only ignite their frenzy.

With a sharp snap of his wings, the crow turned his back on the mob, feigning indifference, and retreated into the Old Oak.

Br'r Rabbit did not stay to watch the fire he had lit. He slipped into the dense undergrowth where Thlayli was waiting.

``Our work here is done.", he whispered, a youthful mischievous glint in his old eyes, ``Let's get out of here before it turns ugly."\\

As soon as Eaglewing was out of sight from the Glade, he let his fury be known. His wings flapped violently, knocking over a heap of nuts that scattered across the hollow floor.
``Dispatch a magpie for the stoats!", he commanded the nearest crow, abandoning all pretense of composure. ``And summon Hroðulf hither immediately. The Rabbit fancies himself cunning; let us see how his parlor tricks fare against the full weight of Law."\\
\\
The following days the temperature rose sharply. The melted snow and ice saluted the coming of spring with a muddy mess.
Initially, it looked as if Br'r Rabbit's plan had worked as intended. But the animals soon realized that blueberries were a poor substitute. Blueberries were seasonal, and only ripe in late summer. Worse, they all had their wealth tied up in the leaves that were now worthless reducing everyone's savings to nothing.

``How could I be so foolish?", Br'r Rabbit muttered, seeing a rat and beaver barter as neither had any blueberries while he hopped through a trail made muddy by the melted snow. ``Why did I pick blueberries...? The trick was flaud from the start."
