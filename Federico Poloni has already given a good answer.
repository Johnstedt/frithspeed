Federico Poloni has already given a good answer.

I also wish to offer you some free advice, which you of course do not have to take if you do not wish. It is harsh advice, and I worry it might attract downvotes or upset you, but it's the advice that most people won't have the courage to give because they're worried about upsetting someone.

You seem to be a hard-working, very intelligent person who has stayed out of trouble (enough to reach the end of a bachelor's degree), and even though I have no idea who you are, I do not want your life to be damaged by starting to walk on a dangerous path.

For some reason even though we haven't met, I care about you. Maybe the reason is that you remind me of myself when I was your age.

(1) First, I cringed when I saw you write "but he's wrong". How can someone be wrong about something?

If I said 1+1=1 would I be "wrong"? 1 raindrop + 1 raindrop = 1 larger (or 'merged') raindrop. 1 Tanganyika + Zanzibar = 1 Tanzania. 1+1=2 when using Peano arithmetic, but you cannot prove that 1+1=2 without something like the Peano axioms and base 3 (or higher) arithmetic. Under different axioms and bases we can prove 1+1=1. In base 2 we can prove 1+1=10. Is 9+4=1 wrong? What about when your exam starts at 9, takes 4 hours, and ends at 1? It might help to be more specific and say "9+4=1 under base 10 Peano arithmetic is wrong" but be careful of GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem: "no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers". This goes beyond just numbers: Croatia won the FIFA World Cup Final against France in 2018 as far as I'm concerned, but many people (including maybe people at FIFA) would prefer to say France won. Democratically my opinion might even be less popular, but where is the rule that democracy is how we decide the truth? If the "democratic truth" were that vaccines cause autism, would you agree with it based on democracy alone?

(2) Let's assume my arguments in (1) about there being no such thing as "right" or "wrong", are extremely weak. Let's agree now that he absolutely was wrong.
You say this is because "there are specific rules for forming those that I consciously followed". Assuming you followed those rules in the way you think is correct, and assuming that the way you think is correct is the way everyone else thinks is the correct way to follow those rules, I still may ask: Were those rules made by humans or gods? In English we have a saying "rules are meant to be broken". In this paragraph I'm only saying that your argument for why he is wrong, does not come across to me as very strong (no rhyme intended, haha).

After accusing someone with far more academic credentials than you of being "wrong", you have written numerous times that the argument for right/wrong here is not simple. Of the many comments, here I pick out just one: "@FedericoPoloni It is not entirely black and white; it depends on which way you interpret the word. But one interpretation is more suitable than the other." This means that no matter who is 'right' or 'wrong', I would advise you to approach the situation with more equanimity, humbleness and poise. This leads me into the next paragraph...

(3) Let's say he is wrong, and your reasoning for that is bullet proof, and the reason why it's wrong is not as complicated as you describe but is instead extremely simple.
Since you're a self-described "language nerd", could you not think of a more peaceful, less abrasive way to describe the situation than to say he is "wrong"?

Telling an academic (whether they are junior to you or senior to you, but in this case they are far senior to you) that they are "wrong" is usually one of the worst things you can do if you want a happy outcome. The thesaurus can assist you in finding a way to say the same thing but with more appropriate words.

(4) About your statement: "If your thesis is really important and read by millions of people, the correction could be worth the risk of a worse grade."
It is completely up to you how you want the final product to be, and what risks you want to take. What I want to say is that I fear from the tone of everything, that you are falling into the same trap into which I have seen far too many people fall (including myself, and including a friend who was finishing her 2-year master's degree while I was not even done 75% of my bachelor's: she said when she submitted her thesis "now I will win the Nobel Prize"). I know you will tell me that saying "millions of people" was an exaggeration, but the attitude behind even considering to write that is what worries me.

I also worry that for several paragraphs now, I may have come across as discouraging (unintentionally), when in fact what I wanted to do was give you advice that will help you succeed. Let me offer you $5000 to support your academic career, if your bachelor's thesis reaches 50 citations in 10 years.

Let me finish with some words of advice that I think would benefit anyone at your academic stage.
From the way you speak, I'm quite sure you're one of the top students in your program, in your cohort, at your university. Maybe you are even ranked #1, but there's people ranked #1 at other universities too, and you might meet some of them when you study for your master's, or PhD. If you manage to be ranked #1 in your year during your PhD, remember there will be people that were ranked #1 in the year before you and the year after you, and two years before you, and two years after you, and three years before you, and so on. The pool of candidates for postdoctoral positions typically spans 5 years of people with PhDs, often even more (many postdoc fellowships require the candidate to have finished their PhD within the last 5 years). Most post-docs these days still don't have as much control over things as they may like, as they are still working directly under a supervisor that often even pays their salary. The best or most senior post-PhD academics may become a "research fellow" which is more independent but still does't carry the "professor" title. These days, most of these people still do not reach the rank of Assistant Professor. Some assistant professors don't reach associate professor and most don't reach full professor. Full professors still have a boss, as departments typically have associate chairs, then chairs, within a faculty that has associate deans and deans, within a university that has associate vice presidents and vice presidents, before the highest ranks (typically: provost, president, vice-chancellor, chancellor). The world is big!

You do seem like you're one of the best in your year, and you have a bright future ahead of you, and maybe nothing can stop you if you manage to continue avoiding this virus called "arrogance". Arrogance kills academic careers. Today, it is harder to get a job than it ever was before. Academic institutions are switching to online courses: we don't need as many teachers. Kids are learning python: I have high school students doing work that senior post-docs used to do. More experiments are becoming automated. A larger percentage of the world has a PhD, compared to any era before: We have more people with PhDs than the number of people in the workforce that we truly need having even a bachelor's degree. If someone doesn't like you, they will hire someone else. My advice is to continue to work on being "likeable" just as much as you've worked on being a language nerd (which is something you called yourself). I'm happy that you're cognizant of this already, since you wrote about being concerned to "engage in spelling debate which can come across as pretentious". I hope it also helped to see that saying someone is "wrong" or even thinking that, can be seen as pretentious. I know you wouldn't say it directly to the assessor, but the fact that you wrote it here means you were thinking it.
